DESCRIPTION : This project builds a recommendation system in Java using Apache Mahout — a scalable machine learning library. The system recommends products or content to users based on their historical preferences, leveraging collaborative filtering.
It reads user-item preference data from a file and uses Mahout’s built-in algorithms (like PearsonCorrelationSimilarity) to find similar users and generate personalized recommendations. The system is ideal for e-commerce sites, streaming platforms, and content portals.
Technologies & Libraries Used:
Java
Apache Mahout
Maven (for dependency management)
Eclipse / IntelliJ / VS Code (IDE)
